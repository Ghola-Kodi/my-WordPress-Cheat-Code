# my-WordPress-Cheat-Code
Welcome to my collection of WordPress Cheat Code Snippets – the one I use for my themes and plugins. They are great for themes, plugins, custom development, widgets, and all things WordPress.
 
 What to Expect

This repository contains battle-tested WordPress code snippets that I've collected, refined, and used in real projects. They're organized like a well-stocked toolbox:
Theme Customization
How to properly load CSS/JS (without making your site slower)
Adding theme supports like a pro (post thumbnails, menus, etc.)
Customizing those pesky template parts
Custom Post Types & Taxonomies
Register custom content types (because sometimes posts and pages just aren't enough)
Create custom taxonomies to organize your content
All with Gutenberg/block editor support!
Query Modifications
Custom queries that don't slow your site to a crawl
Modifying the main query without breaking everything
The right way to get featured posts
Security & Optimization
Simple security tweaks that actually matter
Cleaning up WordPress' messy <head> section
Performance optimizations that don't require 15 plugins
Admin Customizations
Making the WordPress admin less... WordPressy
Adding helpful dashboard widgets
Custom columns that show what you actually care about
 Utility Functions
Handy functions I use in nearly every project
Better excerpt functions (the default one is so limited!)
Featured image helpers that save time
How to Use These 
For Themes: Drop into your functions.php (but consider making a custom plugin instead!)
For Plugins: These make great starting points for your own functionality
For Learning: Read the comments to understand how WordPress really works
Pro Tip: Don't just copy-paste blindly! These are templates – customize them for your specific needs.
